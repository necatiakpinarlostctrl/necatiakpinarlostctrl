Hi, I'm Necati Akpinar
===============================

Senior Game Developer
---------------------

My gaming adventure, which started with Atari, led to my dream of developing a game one day. Because of the passion inside me, I started to develop games and make large projects that would take me to the next level in game development. I acquired the perspective needed to be a good programmer through my ability to overcome the challenges I have faced.
